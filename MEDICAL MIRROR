The Medical Mirror is designed to offer instant blood test reports using advanced sensors and analysis algorithms
Addressing delays in traditional blood testing methods which can be critical in emergency situations.
Key features include providing immediate feedback on various blood parameters, a user-friendly interface for both healthcare professionals and patients.
High precision in test results using advanced sensors and algorithms, and integration with electronic health records (EHR) for comprehensive health management.
Components involve:
Hardware: Mirror with built-in sensors for blood analysis, a microcontroller for processing data, and connectivity modules (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for data transfer).
Software: Frontend user interface for displaying results and interacting with the mirror, backend algorithms for analyzing test results and managing data, and a database for storing test results and patient records.
The technology stack includes:
Sensors and Hardware: High-resolution sensors, microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
Programming Languages: Python, C/C++ for hardware programming; JavaScript, HTML, CSS for frontend development.
Database: SQL or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Machine Learning: For analyzing blood test results.
Implementation steps involve:
Researching existing blood testing technologies and designing the sensor system with required components.
Building a prototype of the mirror with integrated sensors and developing initial software for data collection and result display.
Conducting rigorous testing to ensure accuracy and reliability, iterating based on feedback and testing results.
Deploying the system in a controlled environment for real-world testing, gathering user feedback, and making necessary adjustments.
Finalizing the product for broader release and creating user documentation and support materials.
